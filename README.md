# MMTools
This is the shared package to simulate pulse propagation in a fiber with GMMNLSE/UPPE.

It solves the pulse propagation with RK4IP if single mode and MPA if multimode. Besides, it is implemented with an adaptive step-size control. Both passive and gain fibers can be simulated, where gain model includes Gaussian gain and rate-equation gain, for both single mode and multimode.

For details, please see our paper: (link here; wait to be published).
