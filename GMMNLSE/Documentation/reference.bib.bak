  abstract  = {Femtosecond long-wave-infrared (LWIR) pulses have found applications in several fields, but their generation is limited to {$\mathrm{CO}_2$} lasers and solid-state frequency converters. Waveguide-based Raman red shifting provides another promising solution to efficiently generate LWIR pulses. Here, we numerically study LWIR pulse generation in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core fiber. Several excitation schemes are considered, involving one or two pulses at either the same or different wavelengths. The analysis reveals that a waveguide structure enables tailoring of the Raman gain, which is required to produce pulses at LWIR wavelengths. With {$\sim$}5-mJ and 50-fs input pulses, clean {400-$\mu$J} and 88-fs pulses at {12 $\mu$m} are theoretically generated with 41\% total quantum efficiency. The simulations also provide insight into the nonlinear dynamics of the Raman gain, where the concept of a phonon amplifier underlies the optimal performance that can be achieved. Only the two-pulse scheme with a two-color source creates a good phonon amplifier for efficient LWIR generation.},

  abstract  = {The nonlinear propagation of picosecond or femtosecond optical pulses in multimode fiber amplifiers underlies a variety of intriguing physical phenomena as well as the potential for scaling sources of ultrashort pulses to higher powers. However, existing theoretical models of ultrashort-pulse amplification do not include some critical processes, and, as a result, they fail to capture basic features of experiments. We introduce a numerical model that combines steady-state rate equations with the unidirectional pulse propagation equation, incorporating dispersion, Kerr and Raman nonlinearities, and gain/loss-spectral effects in a mode-resolved treatment that is computationally efficient. This model allows investigation of spatiotemporal processes that are strongly affected by gain dynamics. Its capabilities are illustrated through examinations of amplification in few-mode gain fiber, multimode nonlinear amplification, and beam cleaning in a multimode fiber amplifier.},

  abstract = {The use of an adaptive step size selection significantly reduces the computational effort for the numerical solution of the generalized nonlinear SchrOumldinger equation (GNLSE). The most commonly employed adaptive step size method is based on the estimation of the local error by applying step size doubling and local extrapolation. While this method works well in combination with the globally second-order split-step Fourier (SSF) integration scheme, it can be significantly improved when the highly accurate fourth-order Runge-Kutta in the interaction picture (RK4IP) method is used for integration, which was recently introduced into the nonlinear optics field. It is demonstrated that the local error can then be estimated using a conservation quantity error (CQE) without the necessity of step size doubling. The CQE method for solving the GNLSE is explained in detail, and in addition the concept is transferred to the normal nonlinear Schrodinger equation and extended to include linear loss. The RK4IP-CQE combination proves to be the most efficient algorithm for the modeling of ultrashort pulse propagation in optical fiber, reducing the computational effort by up to ~50% relative to the local error method.},

A comparative analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of the pulses at the output of various compressor schemes with an internal telescope has been performed. The analysis has been carried out using two methods: calculating additional compressor dispersion using the Seidel aberration coefficients of the internal telescope and the ray tracing method. A ray-tracing algorithm has been developed that allows to calculate the spatiotemporal and spatiospectral pulse intensity distributions at the output of compressors with an internal telescope. The on-axis and off-axis Offner schemes, Martinez scheme compressor and compressor scheme with a single-lens internal telescope are analyzed. It is shown, that the ray tracing method more accurately takes into account system aberrations, including high-order aberrations, while the calculation with the Seidel aberration coefficients takes into account only primary aberrations. According to the analysis, the optimal scheme of a grating compressor with an internal telescope for compressing negatively chirped pulses in the range of 1410 nm to a duration of less than 40 fs and energies up to ~ 0.8 J is the off-plane Offner scheme.},

  abstract = {{Raman scattering has found renewed interest owing to the development of gas-filled hollow-core fibers, which constitute a unique platform for exploration of novel ultrafast nonlinear phenomena beyond conventional solid-core-fiber and free-space systems. Much progress has been made through models for particular interaction regimes, which are delineated by the relation of the excitation pulse duration to the time scales of the Raman response. However, current experimental settings are not limited to one regime, prompting the need for tools spanning multiple regimes. Here, we present a theoretical framework that accomplishes this goal. The theory allows us to review recent progress with a fresh perspective, makes new connections between distinct temporal regimes of Raman scattering, and reveals new degrees of freedom for controlling Raman physics. Specific topics that are addressed include transient Raman gain, the interplay of electronic and Raman nonlinearities in short-pulse propagation, and interactions of short pulses mediated by phonon waves. The theoretical model also accommodates vector effects, which have been largely neglected in prior works on Raman scattering in gases. The polarization dependence of transient Raman gain and vector effects on pulse interactions via phonon waves is investigated with the model. Throughout this Perspective, theoretical results are compared to the results of realistic numerical simulations. The numerical code that implements the new theory is freely available. We hope that the unified theoretical framework and numerical tool described here will accelerate the exploration of new Raman-scattering phenomena and enable new applications.}},
